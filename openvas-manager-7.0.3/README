About OpenVAS Manager
---------------------

The OpenVAS Manager is the central management service between security scanners
and the user clients.

It manages the storage of any vulnerability management configurations and of the
scan results. Access to data, control commands and workflows is offered via the
XML-based OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP). The primary scanner 'OpenVAS Scanner'
is controlled directly via OTP protocol while any other remote scanner is coupled
with the OSP protocol.

OpenVAS Manager is licensed under GNU General Public License Version 2 or
any later version.  Please see file COPYING for details.

Howto use
---------

Starting OpenVAS Manager:

In case everything was installed using the defaults, then starting the manager
can be done with this simple command:

    openvasmd


A command like

    openvasmd --update

or

    openvasmd --rebuild

will update the Manager's NVT cache, and then exit.  The cache must be
updated every time the OpenVAS Scanner syncs with the NVT feed.  The --rebuild
option is faster as it locks the database the entire time, whereas --update
allows clients to access the Manager during the update.

An update within a running Manager can also be invoked by sending the main
Manager process the SIGHUP signal (signal number 1).
