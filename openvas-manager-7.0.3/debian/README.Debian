Notes about openvas-manager
---------------------------

To fully initialize the database of openvas-scanner, you still have to run
the following commands after installation:

$ sudo greenbone-nvt-sync
$ sudo greenbone-scapdata-sync
$ sudo greenbone-certdata-sync

$ sudo openvasmd --rebuild --progress

This is currently not done automatically as it can take a long time and
grabs lots of data from the network.
