openvas-manager (1.98.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Report Format plugin framework. All previous reporting features
      were converted to plugins. The XML representation of a report
      is now the base for any plugin and thus consistency of reports
      is improved.

      Report Format Plugins can be set active so that they
      appear in the selection lists. Selections can consider
      content types so that for example only the plugins with
      content type "text" are offered as Email body.

      It is possible to use parameters for the plugins so the
      user can adjust the behaviour of the Report Format to
      the individual preferences or needs.

      A verification method allows to distribute signatures
      for valid plugins via the NVT Feed.
    - New default Report Format: TXT for simple text.
    - New default Report Format: LaTeX for LaTeX source.
    - New sample Report Format: Simple Bar Chart.
      Demonstrates how to use Gnuplot for graphical reports.
    - New sample Report Format: Simple Topo Plot.
      Demonstrates how to use Graphviz for graphical reports.
    - New sample Report Format: Simple Pie Chart.
      Demonstrates how to use PyChart for graphical reports.
    - New sample Report Format: Simple Map Plot.
      Demonstrates how to use MapServer and GDAL for graphical reports.
    - New sample Report Format: Sourcefire Host Input.
    - Demonstrates that Report Formats can be used to build connectors.
    - Master-Slave feature. Any OpenVAS Manager can use one or many other
      OpenVAS Manager as slave to run scans. The whole scan task
      is transferred to the slave, results are continuously reported
      to the Master during scan process. After the scan is finished
      all data are removed from the slave.

      The master can also retrieve system reports from the slave and
      thus can collect the performance overview for all configured slaves.
    - New Escalator: HTTP GET. This allows for example to access
      text message (SMS) gateways or ticket management systems.
    - Extended Escalator: For EMail escalation it is now possible
      to select from configured Report Formats to be included in the
      Email body.
    - Agents: A verification method was added. This allows to
      distribute signatures for valid agents via the NVT Feed.
    - Credentials: Can now be edited. This allows to change the login
      name or password without the need to create a new scan configuration.
    - Credentials: Auto-generated installer packages are now created on
      the fly. If the generators are improved, it is now easy to create
      an updated package for already existing credentials.
    - OMP self-documentation: Part of the Managers' XML-based communication protocol
      OMP 2.0 is to deliver the full specification and documentation of the
      protocol itself (command "HELP"). It can be retrieved as XML-,
      RNC- or HTML representation.
    - Targets: Various opportunities have been added to specify and combine IP ranges.
    - Tasks: The task overview is delivered much faster now.
    - Reports: The report filtering is much faster now.
